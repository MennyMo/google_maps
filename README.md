## Generated Random Data a Using Faker, an npm module

Generating Company name and Users
install faker
```sh
npm install faker@5.5.3
```
```sh
npm install @types/faker@5.5.9
```

Faker package helps to generate a bunch of different types of information.
install parcel 
```sh
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```
Parcel is a package that helps to run typescript in the browser

```sh
npm install @types/google.maps
```

use this command to run the project

```sh
parcel index.html 
```

set global variable(this tells TS that there is a global variable): 
to do that I had to install a type definition file(to help TS understand how a 3rd party JS library works)
```sh
npm install @types/google.maps
```


bad code to add markers
